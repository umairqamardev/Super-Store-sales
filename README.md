# Super-Store-sales

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard developed using the SuperStore Sales Dataset, a sample dataset commonly used for business intelligence and data visualization exercises. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into sales performance, customer segmentation, product trends, regional analysis, and profitability metrics. It is designed to support data-driven decision-making by offering interactive visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) across multiple dimensions.

The project demonstrates practical applications of Power BI features such as slicers, filters, drill-downs, and calculated measures to analyze business performance effectively.
